  <p><b>Goal and Scope</b></p>
  <p>The ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on the Foundations of Software
  Engineering (FSE) is an internationally-renowned forum for researchers
  and practitioners from academia and industry to present and discuss
  the most recent innovations, trends, experiences, and challenges in
  software engineering.</p>

  <p>We invite high quality submissions describing significant, original,
  and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and
  experimental software engineering research. We solicit submissions
  relating to all aspects of software engineering. Topics of interest
  include, but are not limited to:</p>

  <p class="indent20">
  Architecture and design<br>
  Components, services, and middleware<br>
  Configuration management and deployment<br>
  Distributed, parallel and concurrent software<br>
  Economics and metrics<br>
  Embedded and real-time software<br>
  Empirical studies of software engineering<br>
  End user software engineering<br>
  Formal methods<br>
  Knowledge-based software engineering<br>
  Mobile, ubiquitous and pervasive software<br>
  Model-driven software engineering<br>
  Patterns and frameworks<br>
  Policy and ethics<br>
  Processes and workflows<br>
  Program comprehension and visualization<br>
  Requirements engineering<br>
  Reverse engineering and maintenance<br>
  Security, safety and reliability<br>
  Software tools and development environments<br>
  Specification and verification<br>
  Testing and analysis<br>
  User Interfaces<br>
  Web software and cloud computing
  </p>

  <p><b>How To Submit</b></p>
  <p>Papers submitted for consideration should not have been published
  elsewhere and should not be under review or submitted for review
  elsewhere during the duration of consideration. ACM plagiarism
  policies and procedures will be followed for cases of double
  submission:</p>

  <p class="indent20"><a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy">http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy</a></p>

  <p>Research papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format through
  the conference web site and must follow ACM's proceedings format strictly,
  including font sizes, line spacing, and margins:</p>

  <p class="indent20"><a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates</a></p>

  <p>Papers must not exceed 11 pages, with
  up to 10 pages for all text and figures, and up to one additional page
  for the list of references only. All submissions must be in
  English. Submissions that do not
  comply with these instructions will be desk rejected without
  review.</p>

  <p>This year FSE will allow optional electronic submission of an appendix
  file. The appendix file can be submitted using the FSE submission site
  together with the paper. The appendix file must be in a commonly
  supported format (such as PDF or zip).</p>

  <p>Please submit your paper via the submission page on Easychair.org
  which can be found
  <a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fse2012">here</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Evaluation</b></p>
  <p>Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the
  Program Committee (except in the event of an unexpectedly large number
  of submissions). Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of
  originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation,
  reproducibility, quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison
  to related work. The program committee as a whole will make final 
  decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the 
  conference.</p>

  <p><b>Research Artifacts and Appendix</b></p>
  <p>Submissions that facilitate reproducibility and follow-up research by
  using available data sets, publicly providing data sets, or making
  tools publicly available are especially encouraged. Publicly providing
  reusable research artifacts (data or tools) is not mandatory, but will
  strengthen the reproducibility of the research, which is an explicit
  evaluation criterion. To recognize the contribution of a significant
  and high-quality research artifact, the program committee will select
  one of the accepted papers to receive a "Best Artifact Award".</p>

  <p>The appendix provides a means to include complementary information
  with the paper that will remain confidential to the program
  committee. The appendix can be used to provide extra material that
  could be useful in evaluation of the contribution, such as: detailed
  proofs of theoretical claims, partial or complete data sets, scripts
  and statistical formulas, more extensive tool outputs, screen shots or
  videos of tools, etc.</p>

  <p>The authors cannot use the appendix as additional space for explaining
  their contribution. The research papers must be self-contained.
  Reviewers will not be required to read the appendix, but will be
  encouraged to consult the appendix to resolve the questions that may
  arise during the reviewing process. There is no limit on the size of
  the appendix, although authors should keep in mind that large
  appendices will be unlikely to be examined by the reviewers due to time
  constraints.</p>

  <p>Authors who are planning to make their artifacts public in the event
  that their submission is accepted are encouraged to provide these
  artifacts for confidential review as a part of the on-line appendix,
  and to clearly indicate what will be made public. Such contributions
  will be considered for the artifact award (with the reservation that
  claims of availability will be verified prior to announcement of the
  artifact award).</p>

  <p><i>To be considered for the Best Artifact Award, please check the box
  labeled "This paper includes description of a publicly available
  research artifact" on the submission page (under the title and
  abstract).</i></p>
