<h1>Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award</h1>
<p>The SIGSOFT Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award is presented annually to the author of an outstanding doctoral dissertation in the area of Software Engineering. The author of the winning dissertation will be invited to publish a dissertation summary in the SIGSOFT newsletter, Software Engineering Notes (SEN). The award includes a $1000 honorarium and a plaque for the author, which is presented at the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), and funding support for the recipient to travel to ICSE to receive the award (including a registration to ICSE). A public citation for the award dissertation will be placed on the SIGSOFT web site. The award recipient also receives support for travel to ICSE up to $2500 within their home continent and up to $3000 outside their home continent, including airfare, hotel, and conference registration for ICSE.</p>
<p>The award is for an outstanding dissertation (in software engineering) dated within the year preceding the nomination due date. For nominations for the November 4, 2024 deadline, dissertations dated November 4, 2023 to November 3, 2024 are eligible.</p>

<p>To submit a nomination for the award, please use the <a href="https://sigsoft-awards.hotcrp.com/">awards nomination portal</a>. Please note that:</p>

<ul>

<li> An <strong>intent to nominate</strong> must be submitted in the nomination system by October 21, 2024 (third Monday in October). The intent submission is very lightweight and only requires: (1) full name and affiliation of the nominee, (2) contact information of the nominator, and (3) some metadata.

<li>Succinct description of why the nominee is well-qualified for the award (200-500 words)</li>
<li>Up to three support letters (200-300 words will be sufficient for each support letter, although longer statements of support are of course welcome). Each support letter must include the following sentence: "To the best of my knowledge, the candidate I am endorsing has not committed any action that violates the ACM Code of Ethics and ACM's Core Values.</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ul>
