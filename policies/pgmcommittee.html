       <h2>Program Committee Members</h2>
       <p>The program committee is
       responsible for objectively and thoroughly reviewing all submissions,
       for submitting timely, informative reviews that provide authors 
       with feedback
       about their submissions, and for attending the program committee meetings.
       </p>    
       <p>The program committee members should be recognized experts in the 
       subject
       area of the event. For recurring events, at least one-third of the program
       committee membership should change. Most program committee members should
       not serve for more than three consecutive terms and in no instance should
       an individual serve more than four consecutive terms.</p>
       
       <a name="rev_sub"></a>
       <h2>Reviewing Submissions</h2>
       <p>Submissions should be reviewed
       by the program committee members themselves, rather than by their chosen
       delegates, so that the submissions can be discussed by knowledgeable 
       reviewers
       during the program committee meeting. Program committee members can seek
       expert advice from external reviewers, if they so desire, but they are
       still responsible for having reviewed the submission themselves. Each
       submission should be reviewed by at least three program committee members
       and there should be an opportunity given to discuss each submission at
       the program committee meeting. Usually those submissions that have received
       very poor reviews or very strong reviews can be discussed only briefly,
       but an open discussion provides other committee members who might be 
       familiar
       with the work an opportunity to contribute useful information that might
       affect the outcome of the review process. If consensus can not be formed
       or there are additional concerns raised about a submission, additional
       information or reviews should be obtained. </p>
       <p>Any
       restrictions on submissions by program committee members must be clearly
       conveyed by the Program Chair as part of the invitation to join the 
       committee.
       It is important that the program committee consider all submissions fairly.
       Therefore, if program committee members are allowed to make submissions,
       care must be taken that they are reviewed at least as stringently as other
       submissions.</p>
      
       <a name="sub_org"></a>
       <h2>Submissions from Organizing Committee Members</h2>
       <p>For conferences and symposia, the General Chair and Program Chair of the event may not submit to any track of the event. This restriction also extends to the General Chair's and Program Chair's directly supervised students. This restriction does not apply to workshops and collocated events. All other members of the Organizing Committee and their directly supervised students may submit to any track other than the track they are chairing. Directly-supervised students are defined as only those students who are conducting their research under the primary guidance of the General Chair or Program Chair, and not those students who must have the General Chair or Program Chair as their diploma/thesis/dissertation chair of record due to university, state, province, or national rules, but are primarily advised by other (e.g., more junior) professors.</p>
      
       <a name="con_int"></a>
       <h2>Conflicts of Interest and Confidentiality of Submissions</h2>
       <p>SIGSOFT requires members of the program committees of its events to adhere 
       to the highest of ethical standards. Program committee chairs must ensure 
       that these standards are not only met to the letter of the policy but also 
       to the spirit of its intent. This means that even the appearance of a conflict 
       of interest or breach of confidentiality in the selection process should 
       be avoided.</p> 
       <p> A program committee member (including the chair of the committee) is 
       considered to have a conflict of interest on a submission that has an 
       author in any of the following categories:</p>
         <ol>
           <li>the person themselves;</li> 
           <li>a past or current student or academic advisor;</li>
           <li>a supervisor or employee in the same line of authority within the 
             past three years;</li>
           <li>a member of the same organization (e.g., company, university, government 
             agency, etc.) within the past three years;</li>
           <li>a co-author of a paper appearing in publication within the past three 
             years;</li>
           <li>someone with whom there has been a financial relationship (e.g., grants, 
             contracts, consultancies, equity investments, stock options, etc.) within 
             the past three years;</li>
           <li>someone with whom acceptance or rejection would further the personal 
             goals of the reviewer (e.g., a competitor);</li>
           <li>a member of the same family or anyone considered a close personal 
             friend; or</li>
           <li>someone about whom, for whatever reason, their work cannot be evaluated 
             objectively.</li>
         </ol>
       <p> Committee members must declare their conflicts to the program chair 
       before any discussions of the submissions begin.</p>
       <p> Committee members in conflict with an author will not be allowed to 
       see the reviews of the submission, nor will the names of the reviewers 
       be divulged. During any and all discussions of the submission (e.g., at 
       the program committee meeting, during pre-meeting email discussions, etc.), 
       the member in conflict will be barred from participating in any way either 
       actively or passively (e.g., by absenting themselves from the room in 
       which the discussion is being held, not being a recipient of email, etc.).</p>
       <p> In case the program chair is in conflict, the chair will assign an alternate 
       chair for any submissions for which they have a conflict. For those submissions, 
       the alternate chair will select the reviewers and will chair the discussion 
       of the submission in the program chair's absence. As a concession to practicality 
       in the mechanics of organizing and reporting the results of the review 
       process, the program chair is permitted to view all reviews for all submissions, 
       including those with which they have a conflict. Nevertheless, the program 
       chair must maintain the confidentiality of those reviews.</p>
       <p> The discussions conducted by a program committee during the selection 
       process are considered to be confidential.</p> 
       <p> This conflict of interest and confidentiality policy extends to any 
       supplemental reviewers outside of the immediate program committee, if 
       such reviewers are permitted by the procedures of the committee. The committee 
       member seeking the supplemental review is responsible for ensuring the 
       enforcement of the policy.</p>
       <p> The program chair will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the manuscripts 
       submitted are made available to and reviewed only by the program committee 
       and supplemental reviewers acting on behalf of the program committee. 
       Neither SIGSOFT nor ACM guarantee the confidentiality of the submitted 
       manuscripts, and accept no liability in the event that the manuscripts 
       are distributed beyond the reviewers.</p> 
      
       <a name="award_spec"></a>
       <h2>Awards and Special Issues of Journals</h2>
       <p>Program committees should present the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished
       Paper Award to an appropriate subset of the accepted submissions;
       rules and details of the award are available 
       <a href="/awards/distinguishedPaperAward.html">here</a>.
       This benefits both
       the authors and the conference by raising visibility in the broader 
       community.
       Distinguished papers should also be considered for expedited review and
       publication in an ACM journal, such as Transactions on Software Engineering
       and Methodology (<a href="http://www.acm.org/tosem/">TOSEM</a>), or in any other suitable
       journal. Again, this has the benefit of raising the visibility of the
       conference. Program chairs should seek prior approval directly from the
       Editor in Chief of the selected publication. Distinguished paper awards
       and expedited journal publication should be noted in the call to make
       submission more appealing to authors.</p>
      
       <a name="call_sub"></a>
       <h2>Calls for Submissions/Participation: </h2>
       <p>Conferences should
       require full-length, original papers for review. Experience shows that
       acceptance decisions based solely on abstracts provide too much opportunity
       for surprises in the final paper. Calls for papers should include explicit
       prohibitions against the submission of papers that have been previously
       published or are being submitted elsewhere. Workshops with limited 
       attendance
       should require participants to submit statements describing their interests
       or experiences so that invitations are based on some objective measure.
       Statements might be in the form of position papers, abstracts, or 
       full-length, original papers.</p>
      
       <p>All calls should encourage students to participate in the event. 
       Information should be included about the 
       <a href="/resources/caps.html">Conference Attendance Program (CAPS)</a>, which provides scholarships 
       for students to help defray the
       cost of attending events, especially if they have an accepted paper at
       a conference.</p> 
      
       <p>In addition, all calls should make authors aware of the 
       <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy">ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.</a>
       Authors must be asked to indicate their
       understanding and acceptance of the policy and procedures at the time
       of submission. This can normally be done as part of the electronic
       submission process, such as through a checkbox that must be checked
       in order for the submission to be recorded.</p>
