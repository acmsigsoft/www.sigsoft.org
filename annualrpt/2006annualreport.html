<h1>SIGSOFT Annual Report</h1>
<h2>July 2005 - June 2006</h2>
<h2>Submitted by: William G. Griswold, SIGSOFT Chair</h2>
<p>SIGSOFT  has  had  an  excellent  year.  A  new  set  of  officers  took  their  positions,  with  a  large  number of new faces coming on board.   Due to the growing number of elected positions being held by Europeans, our European Liaison position was retired, and we instituted a South Asia Liaison, reassigning our Asia Liaison to focus on  North  Asia.</p>
<p>Due  to  the  large  growth  in  the  number  of  conferences  that  we  (co)sponsor  and  cooperate  with,  we  also  reassigned  responsibility  for  in-cooperation  conferences  from  our  Vice  Chair to the Secretary/Treasurer.  We have also more clearly delineated the roles of our at-large members, namely awards, education, and digital library issues.</p>
<p>On the awards front, we continued to make our annual service and research awards. This year's ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Service Award was presented to Prof. Carlo Ghezzi of Politecnico di Milano. We awarded the ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding Research Award to David Harel of The Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. The awards were announced at ICSE 2006 in Shanghai, with  the  presentation  to  Prof.  Ghezzi  taking  place  at  the  conference.  Dr.  Harel  will  receive  his  award  at  SIGSOFT  2006  in  November  2006,  and  will  give  a  keynote  address.  We  made  a  number of ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper awards across our sponsored conferences.  We did not award the Most Influential Paper from ICSE N-10 this year, as the ICSE 2006 PC chose not to award a paper. We made several dozen awards to students for travel support to SIGSOFT-sponsored conferences, under our CAPS (Conference Attendance Program for Students). Finally, we  are  proud  to  have  ACM's  approval  for  the  Frank  Anger  Memorial  Award,  a  joint  SIGSOFT-SIGBED student travel award in honor of the memory of Frank Anger, who served the community for many years through his work as a program director at NSF.</p>
<p>Our  major  conferences  continue  to  be  strong  -  in  attendance,  sound  finances,  and  intellectual  vibrancy.  ESEC/FSE  2005  was  held in  Lisbon,  Portugal,  under  the  leadership  team  of  Michel  Wermelinger (general chair) and Harald Gall (program chair). ICSE 2006 was held in Shanghai, China,  under  the  leadership  team  of  Leon  Osterweil  (general  chair),  and  Mary  Lou  Soffa  and  Dieter  Rombach  (program  co-chairs).  Holding  ICSE  -  a  multi-track  event  on  the  scale  of  a  thousand  participants  -  in  a  country  with  an  emerging  economy  and  high-tech  industry  was  a  major  accomplishment.  The  event  was  critical  to  helping  the  global  community  appreciate  the  monumental changes that are taking place in China and throughout Asia.</p>
<p>SIGSOFT  2006  will  be  in  Portland,  Oregon,  with  Michal  Young  as  general  chair  and  Prem  Devanbu  as  program  chair.  FSE  2007  will  be  joint  with  the  European  Software  Engineering  Conference (ESEC) in Dubrovnik, Croatia, in September 2007.  Antonia Bertolino is the program chair,  and  Ivica  Crnkovic  is  the  general  chair.  SIGSOFT  2008  is  planned  to  be  held  in  Atlanta,  Georgia in November of that year, with Mary Jean Harrold as General Chair and Gail Murphy as program Chair.  ICSE 2007 will be in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with John Knight as general chair, and  Wolfgang  Emmerich  and  Gregg  Rothermel  as  program  co-chairs.  ICSE  2008  will  be  in  Leipzig, Germany, with Wilhelm Sch&auml;fer as general chair, and Matthew Dwyer and Volker Gruhn as program co-chairs. ICSE 2009 is planned for Vancouver BC, Canada, with Stephen Fickas as General Chair and Paola Inverardi and Joanne Atlee as program co-chairs.</p> 
<p>We continue to experiment with the affordances of digital publishing.  For the second year, ICSE has  provided  a  paper  proceedings  only  as  an  option.  This  year,  the  proceedings  instead  was  made  available  on  a  USB  memory  stick,  financed  by  a  corporate  donation  to  the  conference.    FSE  2006  will  take  a  digital  publication  approach  as  well.    Based  on  feedback  from  our  membership at our "Town Meeting" at ICSE 2006, the FSE 2006's proceedings will be available in  the  ACM  Digital  Library  prior  to  the  conference.    This  will  permit  attendees  to  download  and  print  papers  in  advance  of  the  conference,  providing  both  the  cost  benefits  of  digital  publication  and  the  affordances  of  paper.    In  a  parallel  effort,  we  are  now  using  e-mail  to  encourage  our  authors to link their web sites to their articles in the ACM Digital Library.</p>
<p>Will Tracz has continued to make our newsletter, SEN, stronger and better as we move into the digital era.  We have moved away from mailing out two proceedings per year.  Rather than move totally online, SEN still prints and mails "tip of the iceberg" content such as conference abstracts and  key  articles  and  columns  (such  as  RISKS).    This  has  dramatically reduced  costs,  but  provides  the  essential  value  that  SEN  has  always provided  -  bringing  key  information  to  our  membership's attention.</p>
<p>An  important  initiative  that  SIGSOFT  has  engaged  in  is  the  SIGSOFT  Software  Engineering  Dissertation Catalog, whose goals are to create a record of the research activity of our youngest researchers  and  ease  access  to  this  content  for  computer  scientists  and  historians,  which  is  normally  dispersed  in  obscure  locales  on  the  internet.  Begun  by  our  past  Chair  Alex  Wolf,  this  year  we  undertook  an  aggressive  e-mail  solicitation  with  the  help  of  Tao  Xie's  family  tree  of  academic software engineering research.  This has resulted in essentially doubling the content of our catalog, as well as heightening the community's awareness of its presence.</p> 
<p>In the coming year we will be focusing on membership, the digital library as before, revising our bylaws,  and  awards.    Our  membership  has  been  trending  slowly  lower,  as  in  many  SIGs,  but  we're going to be making the case to our broader community that membership brings value that is far  in  excess  of  the  cost  of  membership.    In  particular,  we'll  be  looking  at  international  membership,  student  membership,  and  the  membership  of  our  conference  attendees.    Our  bylaws  are  out  of  date,  and  although  they  are  not doing  us  harm,  they  are  not  serving  us  well,  either.  We have asked David Notkin, a past SIGSOFT chair, to lead an effort to modernize our bylaws.  Many of the remarkable accomplishments of our community are under-recognized.  This coming year we will be putting the Anger Award in to implementation, while also looking to add a dissertation award and perhaps an educator's award.</p>
