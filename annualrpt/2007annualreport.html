<h1>SIGSOFT Annual Report</h1>
<h2>July 2006 - June 2007</h2>
<h2>Submitted by: William G. Griswold, SIGSOFT Chair</h2>
<p>SIGSOFT had an excellent year, maintaining the success of its conferences while continuing to reach out to the community in many dimensions.</p>
<p>Due to the growing number of elected positions being held by Europeans, our European Liaison position was retired, and we instituted a South Asia Liaison, reassigning our Asia Liaison to focus on North Asia.  Due to the large growth in the number of conferences that we (co)sponsor and cooperate with, we also reassigned responsibility for in-cooperation conferences from our Vice Chair to the Secretary/Treasurer.  We have also more clearly delineated the roles of our at-large members, namely awards, education, and digital library issues.</p>
<p>On the awards front, we continued to make our annual service and research awards. This year's ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Service Award was presented to Prof. David Notkin of the University of Washington. We awarded the ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding Research Award to Elaine Weyuker of ATT Labs - Research. The awards were presented to the recipients at ICSE 2007 in Minneapolis. Dr. Weyuker will give a keynote address at the upcoming SIGSOFT-sponsored ESEC/FSE'07 conference in Dubrovnik. We made a number of ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper awards across our sponsored conferences.  We made 84 awards to students for travel support to SIGSOFT-sponsored conferences, under our CAPS (Conference Attendance Program for Students).  This coming year we will again increase funding, but also increase the size of the awards and make fewer of them, focusing on first-time attendees and those in need.  The joint SIGSOFT-SIGBED Frank Anger student travel award saw its first honorees from the SIGBED community this year, and SIGSOFT is in the process of choosing their first awardee at this time. Finally, we are proud to have ACM's approval for the SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award, which will recognize SIGSOFT conference papers of 10 years age or more for their exceptional impact on the community.</p>
<p>Our major conferences continue to be strong - in attendance, sound finances, and intellectual vibrancy. SIGOSFT 2006 was held in Portland, Oregon, with Michal Young as general chair and Prem Devanbu as program chair. ICSE 2007 was held in Minneapolis, MN, under the leadership team of John Knight (general chair), and Gregg Rothermel and Wolfgang Emmerich (program co-chairs). Both events featured SIGSOFT's new "Town Hall Meeting" format whereby we open the floor to an open discussion on the issues of the day, while those present relax with refreshments.</p>
<p>FSE 2007 will be joint with the European Software Engineering Conference (ESEC) in Dubrovnik, Croatia, this September.  Antonia Bertolino is the program chair, and Ivica Crnkovic is the general chair. SIGSOFT 2008 will be held in Atlanta, Georgia in November of that year, with Mary Jean Harrold as General Chair and Gail Murphy as program Chair.  ICSE 2008 will be in Leipzig, Germany, with Wilhelm Sch&auml;fer as general chair, and Matthew Dwyer and Volker Gruhn as program co-chairs. ICSE 2009 will be held in Vancouver BC, Canada, with Stephen Fickas as General Chair and Paola Inverardi and Joanne Atlee as program co-chairs.</p>
<p>We continue to experiment with the affordances of digital publishing.  For the third year, ICSE has provided paper proceedings only as an option.  This year, as last, the proceedings were made available on a USB memory stick, financed by a corporate donation to the conference.  FSE 2006 took a digital publication approach as well.  Based on feedback from our membership at our Town Meetings, FSE 2007's proceedings will be available in the ACM Digital Library prior to the conference.  This will permit attendees to download and print papers in advance of the conference, providing both the cost benefits of digital publication and the affordances of paper.  We continue to use e-mail to encourage our authors to link their web sites to their articles in the ACM Digital Library, and are educating our membership about the benefits of the Digital Library and the Portal.</p>
<p>Will Tracz has continued to make our newsletter, SEN, stronger and better as we move into the digital era.  Because the SEN is produced in two versions, online and a print "tip of the iceberg" summary (including RISKS), production is complicated and time consuming.  To this end, Will will be working with a group of undergraduates at the Rochester Institute of Technology to develop a content management system that can handle the unique work flow to produce these two documents.</p>
<p>In the coming year we will be focusing on membership, the digital library as before, revising our bylaws, and awards.  Our membership has been trending slowly lower, as in many SIGs, but we're going to be making the case to our broader community that membership brings value that is far in excess of the cost of membership.  In particularly, we'll be looking at international membership and student membership.  Our bylaws are out of date, and although they are not doing us harm, they are not serving us well, either.  David Notkin has produced a modernized version of the bylaws, and we will be presenting them to the ACM shortly after the proposed new rules governing bylaws revisions are themselves approved.  Many of the remarkable accomplishments of our community are under-recognized.  This coming year we will be putting the Impact Paper award into implementation, while also looking to add a dissertation award and perhaps an educator's award.</p>
