<p>SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDED A SPRINGBOARD FOR FURTHER TECHNICAL EFFORTS<p>
<p>SIGSOFT has two software engineering education programs - one targeted toward students and the seconded focused on educators.  Students receive discounted membership rates and registration fees at all SIGSOFT - sponsored conferences and workshops.  In addition, our two flagship conferences: ICSE and ESEC/FSE (as well as ISSTA) offer a Doctoral Symposium where students are mentored by experienced Software Engineering professors. Also, SIGSOFT provides travel support to SIGSOFT sponsored or co-sponsored conferences or workshops for graduate and undergraduate students who are SIGSOFT members through the Conference Aid Program for Students (CAPS) - http://www.sigsoft.org/CAPS/. Attendance at conferences and workshops to present papers and to interact with researchers and practitioners in software engineering is an important component of students' education and professional development.  Moreover, students' presence at conferences and workshops enriches and broadens conference and workshop activities. Conferences and workshops are also a good way to introduce students to the services of SIGSOFT.  In FY 2015 over $705K of grants were given to 71 graduate and 6 undergraduate students (out of 131 requests).<p>
<ul>
<li>At ICSE 2015 we are able to fund 56 out of 59 applications.</li>
<li>16 from Europe</li>
<li>11 from Canada</li>
<li>19 from US</li>
<li>2 from Brazil</li>
<li>6 from Asia (China, Japan, India)</li>
<li>One from New Zealand and from Australia</li>
</ul>
<p>SIGSOFT holds Software Engineering Educators Symposium (SEES) in non ESEC/FSE years.  It consists of two half - day tutorials covering approaches for teaching programming and software engineering to undergraduates. Symposium participants are provided access to instructional materials, receive practical tips on how to successfully apply the approaches, and learned about tools that support hands-on instruction and active learning.  ACM SIGSOFT provided funding for this year's FSE in Hong Kong bringing together Asian software engineering educators.<p>
<p>INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS WHICH PROVIDE SERVICE TO SOME PART OF THE TECHNICAL COMMUNITY<p>
<p>To better serve the Software Engineering technical community, SIGSOFT extended the resources it provides to it members by:<p>
<ol>
<li>Creating an Early Career Award that recognizes individuals whose last computer-related educational degree (i.e., baccalaureate, masters, or doctorate degree) was awarded no earlier than 7 years ago at the time of nomination.</li>
<li>Funding the establishment of a CAPS Application Web Site to streamline the processing of applications.  This included providing for room sharing options that could increase the effectiveness of CAPS student funding.</li>
<li>Starting the SIGSOFT Webinar Series in June with three webinars that had over 1000 registerants.  The webinars are archived and open to the general software engineering community.  The webinars are based on the Future of Software Engineering Track at ICSE 2014 as well as recent keynote addresses and workshop summaries.</li>
<li>Creating a web page (http://www.sigsoft.org/resources/opentoc.html) accessible through the SIGSOFT home page with the table of contents and ACM Authorizer links to over 80 ACM conferences.  This provides free access to the proceeding's papers maintained in the ACM DL for a one year period from the conference start date. </li>
<li>Funding the establishment of a series of Symposia in collaboration with local research communities and targeted at South American students and young researchers in order to have a record number of South American submissions, acceptances, and attendance to all ICSE 2017 tracks.  These events are organized in conjunction with, amongst others, CibSE - the Ibero-American Conference on Software Engineering, the Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering, the Argentinian Symposium on Software Engineering, and the annual meeting of the Chilean Computer Society.</li>
</ol>
<p>BROADENING PARTICIPATION EVENTS/PROGRAM <p>
<p>In order to increase participation in SIGSOFT-sponsored events and increase/retain membership, we:<p>
<ul>
<li>Offered free online student memberships to students attending FSE 2014.  A total of 31 students took advantage of this offer</li>
<li>Established a SIGSOFT Chapter in India (iSoft) and created a liaison position on the SIGSOFT EC.  In addition we offered free online access to the iSoft members to the SIGSOFT Newsletter and created a distribution list for its members to receive SIGSOFT announcements.</li>
<li>Added two $10K projects to the 2015 budget to support yet to be determined projects.</li>
<li>Planned for the first SIGSOFT Town Hall meeting at ISSTA (Town Hall meetings previously had been held only at ICSE and ESEC/FSE)</li>
<li>Started laying the foundation for creating a SIGSOFT Chapter in China.</li>
</ul>
<p>BRIEF SUMMARY OF KEY ISSUES FACING THE SIGSOFT MEMBERSHIP<p>
<p>Challenges for the years to come include:<p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing the number of award nominations</li>
<li>Reducing conference/workshop registration fees</li>
<li>Providing more resources to practitioners</li>
<li>Increasing use of social media</li>
<li>Finding more Webinar Speakers and Topics.</li>
<li>Establishing a working relationship with Chinese and South American software engineering Researchers.</li>
</ul>
